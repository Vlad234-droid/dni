      'Our 5 colleague networks underpin our diversity and inclusion strategy and support us in creating a diverse and inclusive culture where everyone is welcome. They advocate for and provide support for diverse communities and their allies, providing safe spaces for colleagues to come together and discuss shared successes or concerns, enhance their career development and access networking opportunities. Our networks also support the wider business D&I agenda and are important in educating allies on their role in elevating diverse voices within the business.',
      'By signing up to one or more of our networks, you will receive updates throughout the year and priority invites to network-run events. We would encourage you to join any network which you are interested in or passionate about, and welcome colleagues to join our networks as friends or allies.',
      'Any information you share with us will be saved securely and anonymised. Any reporting we do will be anonymous and will only be used to understand the needs of our networks and improve the support we offer colleagues.',
