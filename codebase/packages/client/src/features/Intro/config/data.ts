      `Being a more diverse and inclusive company is an <b>enabler of our core purpose</b>: serving customers, communities and the planet a little better every day, and will help us to achieve our priorities. Treating everyone fairly and with respect is a <b>demonstration of our value:</b> we treat people how they want to be treated. We cannot fully live our <b>Code of Business Conduct without role modelling inclusive behaviours.</b> Valuing difference and being inclusive are <b>woven through our Win Together Behaviours.</b>`,
