    'We know that there is more we can do to become a truly inclusive workplace, and to be able to improve, we need a deeper understanding of our colleagues.',
    'If you haven’t already done so, we invite you to take part in ‘This is Me’ and take a few minutes to securely share some personal diversity information with us such as gender identity, faith, sexuality and ability. This information is vital to us becoming a more inclusive workplace by providing valuable insight into our current diversity, identifying areas for improvement, enabling us to make more inclusive decisions and allowing us to participate in legislative and voluntary reporting such as Ethnicity Pay Gap reporting.',
    'Information will be collated and securely stored, and will be linked to your colleague number, but please be assured it will remain confidential and will not be shared with your manager or wider team. This is completely voluntary and you can choose to share all, some, or none of your details with us.',
    'With your help, this action is a critical step in our journey to better understand and celebrate our diverse workforce and become a more inclusive business for all.',
